First-year Computer Science

The Program Exit Assessment (PEA) is a requirement to receive a CEGEP diploma. It is used to demonstrate that students have learned and understood the material taught throughout their time in CEGEP and that they can meaningfully integrate this knowledge in their work. In Computer Science, the Learning Outcomes translate to the student’s ability to solve problems, to work in teams, to manage time, to develop an ethical and professional conduct, to communicate with others, and most importantly to adapt to changes. Computer Science students submit a digital portfolio of all the representative work done throughout the semesters and an end-of-the-year self-reflection. They can also incorporate other assignments they find important in their portfolio.
